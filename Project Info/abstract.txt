Project 2
Study of the selection criteria of point features for efficient SLAM

The computational complexity of SLAM algorithms can be viewed as a result of using all available scene features which are usually huge. We are not sure if all features are really needed or contribute to improve the algorithm results. Considering the objective of reaching an algorithm that can be accurate and works with minimal computational load, we can build a feature selection strategy that works with features expected to contribute well to accuracy enhancement based on physical and geometrical merits.
The selection works needs an academic study to explore its history and aspects, in addition to assessment based on experiments in difficult scenarios where few features ( outdoors) are only available or redundant features such as repeated pattern corridors(indoor). The work can be done with state of art SLAM algorithms whether based on Lidar or visual camera. The assessment metric will consider the accuracy achieved per computational complexity which is quite relevant for real industrial applications.
